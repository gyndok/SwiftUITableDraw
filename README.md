# SwiftUITableDraw
first commit


I play a lot of poker.  When you play multiday events, the venue publishes table assignments prior to the restarts.
This includes chip counts and seats for the people you are playing against.
I would usually just pull the list up and google my opponents so I know if there are any tough players

With this app I am trying to make the process seamless.
You can get an alert in the morning before the restart and immediately know which table you are assigned, 
who you are playing, how many chips they have, and their prior results.
